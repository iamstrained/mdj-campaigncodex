# Where the Wild Things Play

Your creations are vast and need to be conveyed in their proper scope. At the top of this is the overland or wide-shot style maps. These can be world, country, region, province or even smaller scale like cities or other geographic features. _"Scale"_ varies for any story told, but they're all vastly important.

## Tone and Thematics

An overland or "larger story" map conveys a lot, but it leaves a person wanting more. It provides depth, while opening up opportunities for imagination to run wild. Midjourney is great for this as it's one real limitation is a lack of fine details at scale. This means that you will likely as the cartographer have to cobble together numerous maps into one larger story-telling element to eventually share your whole story. Views into this top-level mapping will extend with either variants or "zoom in" portions detailing smaller map styles, or overlays.

As shown below, **what is left to the imagination?**
* What does this town do?
* Is it industrial, or decaying?
* What in the world is that purple mountain about?
* on and on the questions go...
*
