# Places and Things Need to be Known

While Midjourney _can_ provide labeling and some annotating or embellishment, it's ability to provide or resolve your specific annotation desires will be very limited. The best practice for any user looking for higher detail labeling is to avoid using portions of this part of the Codex to ensure your map is not needlessly cluttered and instead use a photograph or image editing application to add your own stylistic labeling, legends, or specific enhancements on top of the Midjourney image.

Prompting information on a map can still lend itself to some AI driven creative niceness.
